## Chaplain

Chaplain is a shared journal service.  The chaplain specification is inspired
by Raft, but is intended to specify a service, whereas Raft specifies a 
protocol.

The prototype will be in Ruby, as I want to minimize the number of things I
need to learn all at once.  The pre-version 1 of the prototype is NOT going
to be permissively licensed, as this stuff is hard to get right, and I want
some sort of assurance that I've gotten it right before turning it loose in the
world.

Pull requests will only be considered if the author includes a file (in the
licenses directory, named for the author) transferring rights to the code to
myself.
